# Inventory

To provide a better context for the design of this tool, a data inventory was developed to inform the design of prototypes.

**1. Who are the users?**
An instructional designer or subject matter expert (SME). The user is experienced in the design of learning objectives or task hierarchies for learning.

**2. Where are the users?**
The user can access this tool online with a desktop / laptop / tablet device through an internet browser. Therefore, the user could be anywhere when they use this interface.

**3. Context of the task**
The context is a user attempting to model learning objectives / tasks in a hierarchical manner for a course of study.  Task modelling can be similar to brainstorming and could be a collaborative effort. It is possible that the person using this tool is working with one or more users (as defined above) to determine what the tasks will be.

**4. Users’ goals**
The user has the goal of modelling the entire course of study in the form of the task hierarchy.  This process may not happen in one single interaction but rather over the course of several sessions where the user(s) create the tasks and decide how they will be organized.

**5. What do they need?**
The user will likely need have the subject material of the course, a list of topics, a syllabus, and a set of overall learning objectives documented to accomplish task input.  The user will need to reference all applicable sources of information to successfully acheive their goal.

**6. Users’ tasks?**
The users’ tasks are categorized as being either cognitive or social.

Cognitive Tasks:
- Navigating the interface
- Adding a new item
- Deciding what to title an item
- Deciding how to order an item

Social Tasks:
- Conversing with a fellow user about a task name
- Asking for input from a fellow user or stakeholder

**7. Users’ subtasks**

Sub-tasks are expressed here for Cognitive Tasks:

- Navigating the interface
	- Finding level of the hierarchy to add to.
	- Locating the save button after adding an item.
- Adding a new item
	- Entering a text description of the item.
	- Entering a numerical ordering designation for the item
- Deciding what to title an item
	- Consulting applicable materials
	- Collaborating with other users
- Deciding how to order an item
	- Consulting applicable materials
	- Reviewing the list as a whole to determine best fit.
